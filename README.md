# Generate New Solar System Bodies
AstroSynthesis plugin for generating new solar systems

This
 plugin is available as a right click popmenu option.  It will generate 
new planets, asteroid belts, planetoids, etc... for a star system 
without changing the name or properties of the star itself.

If this is run on a multiple star system it will generate new data for 
all child stars.  If it is run on a single star that is a child of a 
multiple star system it will only generate new data for the selected 
child star.

A message box will appear when you run the plugin asking of you want to 
allow for random populations.  If you select "Yes" the system generation
 will attempt to place random populations but it is not guaranteed. If 
you select "No" then no populations will be placed.
